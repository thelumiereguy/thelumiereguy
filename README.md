## Hey there, I'm **Piyush Pradeepkumar**

Welcome to my safe haven! :wave:

I work as a Software Engineer at [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/), where I handle Android and KMM. I've worked with Flutter and React Native in the past, but I personally prefer native now. I love working with **Kotlin** and **Rust**. 
</br>
</br>
Besides my work, I love making stuff - **Apps**, **Games**, **Libraries**, **Plugins**, etc. Recently, I've been really interested in **Creative Coding**, so I started learning about Graphics using [OpenGL](https://thebookofshaders.com/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/) framework. I've also been implementing some of them on [Jetpack Compose's](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQiA09eQBhCxARIsAAYRiylVrX1jdnicM47T9optUs5uPtT6xvFesquuJq3BKQO4sZEDJNIfii4aAtw5EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) Canvas, which has been a pleasant experience. 

### Published Apps/ Plugins - 

- [Compose Helper Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18323-compose-helper) - An IntelliJ IDEA plugin to wrap your Composables with another Composable or to remove them altogether.

### Some of my open source work - 

- [NeumorphismView](https://github.com/thelumiereguy/NeumorphismView-Android) - A Neumorphism library for Android, supporting customizations for shadows/highlights to selected child views.
- [CrashWatcher](https://github.com/thelumiereguy/CrashWatcher-Android) - A Custom Uncaught Exception Handler, which shows the stacktrace of the crash, the screens (Activities and Fragments) which lead up to the crash, and the intents and bundle data sent to those screens. You can also share the above data to other apps or just copy the text.
- [ShaderShowcaseApp](https://github.com/thelumiereguy/ShaderShowcaseApp) - A Jetpack Compose-based app to exhibit all the beautiful GLSL Fragment shaders I have ever written, where you can set them as Live Wallpaper.
- [AstroAdventures](https://github.com/thelumiereguy/AstroAdventures-Android) - A mini-game for Android like Space Invaders, where the entire game engine has been written from scratch, in Kotlin. And every visual asset in the game is drawn with code, using Android Custom Views.
